 Rinse 1 cup of tightly packed coriander leaves (cilantro) and 1 to 2 green chillies in fresh water for a few times. Drain all the water.

Then in a small blender or a chutney grinder jar, add the coriander leaves, Â½ teaspoon chaat masala powder and the green chilies (chopped).

You can roughly chop the coriander leaves and green chillies if you prefer. Finally, season everything with a few pinches of salt as chaat masala already has salt in it.

TIP 1: I usually add 2 to 3 green chilies as we prefer a spicy chutney.

TIP 2: You can also add half a portion each of coriander leaves and mint leaves instead of 1 cup of coriander. The mint leaves add a nice minty aroma to the chutney.
